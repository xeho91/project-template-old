# Security Policy

I do my best **to my knowledge** to provide maximum security for you when
you're using _my_ personal projects.

## Privacy

I can promise you that **I will not break any of your digital privacy rights
on my website**. I mean:

-   no tracking,
-   no third-party trackers,
-   no friggin Facebook pixel,
-   no Google Analytics,
-   or whatever else exists these days.

I want to feel safe, and my privacy to be respected on the Internet as much as
you do.

**Lets be humans, not products.**
